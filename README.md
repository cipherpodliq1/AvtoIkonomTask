# AvtoIkonom QA Automation

![E2E Tests](https://github.com/cipherpodliq1/AvtoIkonomTask/actions/workflows/e2e.yml/badge.svg)

End-to-end automation suite for the [AvtoIkonom](https://dev.admin.avtoikonom.com) admin platform, built with **Playwright + Python**.

---

## Overview

This project was built as a QA automation assignment covering the partner management flow of the AvtoIkonom admin platform. The goal was not to write the most tests, but to build a framework that is stable, maintainable, and reflects how a real production automation project would be structured.

The suite covers two test scenarios:

- **TC-01** -- Create a new partner with all required fields and verify persistence
- **TC-02** -- Edit an existing partner and verify the changes are saved *(bonus)*

---

## Engineering Decisions

### Playwright + Python

Playwright was chosen over Cypress as it offers better support for complex UI interactions such as file uploads, custom dropdown components, and Google Maps autocomplete. Python was chosen for readability and natural language test structure.

### Page Object Model -- Lean by Design

The project uses a three-file POM:

- `login_page.py`
- `partners_page.py`
- `partner_form_page.py`

No inheritance chains, no base class abstractions. Each page object exposes only what the tests actually need. Over-engineering a POM for a small suite makes the code harder to read, not easier.

### Centralised Selector File

Every selector in the suite lives exclusively in `selector/selectors.py`. No selector string appears anywhere else in the codebase.

**Why this matters in practice:**

When the UI changes (and it always does), you update one file and the entire suite is healed. No grep across the codebase, no risk of missing an occurrence. Selectors are also named semantically, which makes test code self-documenting -- `PartnerFormSelectors.SAVE_BUTTON` tells you more than a raw CSS string ever could.

**Selector priority:**

1. ID attributes (`#name-field`) -- most stable, tied to developer intent
2. Developer test-id classes (`td.testid-requestNumberColumn`) -- stable column identifiers
3. CSS with meaningful attributes (`input[name='file-upload']`)
4. CSS `:has()` scoping for Ant Design dropdowns
5. Text-based Playwright selectors (`:has-text()`) for buttons

### Ant Design Dropdown Strategy

The platform uses Ant Design's virtual select component, which renders dropdown options in DOM portals. This means a global `.ant-select-item-option` selector matches options from all dropdowns simultaneously, causing instability.

The fix was to scope every dropdown interaction to its specific container using CSS `:has()`:

```python
container = page.locator("div.ant-select:has(#subscription-tier-field)")
container.click()
container.locator(".ant-select-item-option").first.click()
```

This ensures that clicking an option in the subscription dropdown never accidentally hits an option from the type or services dropdown.

### Session-Scoped Authentication

Login runs exactly once per test session. The browser state (cookies, localStorage) is saved to `auth.json` after the first login and restored for every subsequent test via Playwright's `storage_state`.

**Why this matters:**

- Faster test execution -- no repeated login flows
- More realistic -- mirrors how a real user session works
- Isolated failure point -- if auth breaks, it breaks once, clearly

### Unique Test Data per Run

Partner names are generated with a timestamp and random suffix:

```
AutoTest Partner 20260509-171257-tvcluf
```

This prevents test collisions on the shared development environment. If two engineers run the suite simultaneously, their data never interferes. It also makes cleanup trivial -- filter by `AutoTest` to find and remove all test-generated data.

### No `time.sleep()` Anywhere

All waiting is done through Playwright's built-in mechanisms:

- `wait_for_selector(state="visible")` -- wait for an element to appear
- `wait_for_selector(state="hidden")` -- wait for an element to disappear
- `expect(locator).to_be_visible()` -- assertion with built-in retry
- `locator.wait_for(state="visible")` -- pre-click stability check

Hard sleeps make tests slow and brittle. If the application is slow on a given day, a `sleep(2)` either wastes time when the app is fast or causes flakiness when it is slow.

### Google Maps Autocomplete Handling

The Address field uses Google Places Autocomplete (`pac-target-input`). Typing text alone is not enough -- the form validates that an address was selected from the dropdown, not just typed.

The solution types the address string and then waits for and clicks the first `.pac-item` suggestion:

```python
self.page.locator(PartnerFormSelectors.ADDRESS_INPUT).fill(address)
self.page.wait_for_selector(".pac-item", state="visible", timeout=5000)
self.page.locator(".pac-item").first.click()
```

### Logo Upload and Crop Modal

The logo upload field is a hidden `input[type='file']` sibling of the visible upload button. After a file is set, the application opens a ReactCrop modal for image editing. The crop modal must be confirmed before the main form can be submitted.

The crop save button is identified using the Ant Design modal footer's primary button selector, scoped to the crop modal that appears after upload. A committed `fixtures/test_logo.png` ensures the test is fully self-contained and reproducible on any machine.

### Persistence Assertions

Every write operation (create, edit) is followed by a `page.reload()` and a re-assertion of the data. This confirms that the data was actually saved to the backend and is not just held in frontend state.

- pip

---

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
playwright install chromium
```

---

## Configuration

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

The `.env.example` already contains the test environment credentials. No changes needed.

---

## CI/CD

The pipeline runs automatically on every push to `main` and every pull request. It can also be triggered manually from the **Actions** tab in GitHub using `workflow_dispatch`.

**Pipeline steps:**

1. Checkout code
2. Set up Python 3.11 (with pip caching)
3. Install Python dependencies
4. Install Chromium browser
5. Run full test suite with HTML reporting
6. Upload HTML report as artifact
7. Upload Playwright traces on failure

**Required GitHub Secrets:**

| Secret | Value |
|--------|-------|
| `BASE_URL` | `https://dev.admin.avtoikonom.com` |
| `QA_EMAIL` | `test_qa_1@example.com` |
| `QA_PASSWORD` | `test_qa_1@example.com` |

## QA Practices Applied

**Stable selectors** -- ID-first selector strategy with all selectors centralised in one file. Developer test-id classes (`testid-*`) used for table column targeting. When the UI changes, one file changes.

**Test isolation** -- Each test generates its own unique data and does not depend on state left by another test. TC-02 creates its own partner rather than relying on TC-01 having run first.

**Meaningful failure messages** -- Helper utilities propagate descriptive error messages so that when a test fails in CI, the log tells you exactly what was expected.

**No hard waits** -- Zero `time.sleep()` calls. All synchronisation is done through Playwright's event-driven waiting mechanisms.

**Persistence verification** -- Every create and edit operation is followed by a page reload to confirm the data survived a round trip to the backend.

**Session reuse** -- Authentication runs once per session and is shared across all tests via `storage_state`, keeping the suite fast and the login flow as a single potential failure point.

**Committed test fixtures** -- The `test_logo.png` file is committed to the repository, making the suite fully self-contained. A reviewer can clone and run without any additional setup beyond `pip install`.

**Pinned dependencies** -- All packages in `requirements.txt` are version-pinned to ensure identical behaviour across local machines, CI runners, and reviewer environments.

**HTML reporting** -- Every test run produces a self-contained HTML report, available both locally and as a CI artifact.
